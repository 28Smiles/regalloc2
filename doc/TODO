# Features

- Rematerialization
- Stack-location constraints that place operands in user-defined stack
  locations (distinct from SpillSlots) (e.g., stack args)

# Performance

- Investigate better register hinting
- Investigate more principled cost functions and split locations,
  especially around loop nests

# Cleanup

- Remove support for non-SSA code once no longer necessary
